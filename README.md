### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into car sales performance over the past year. By analyzing key sales metrics, customer preferences, and regional trends, we seek to identify patterns, optimize sales strategies, and support data-driven decision-making to enhance overall dealership performance.

### Data Sources
Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "car_sales.csv" file, which contains detailed information about each car sold.

### Tools
- PowerBI - Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Creating reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, the following tasks were performed:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
- How are the total sales performance?
- How has the average selling price changed over time?
- How many cars have been sold, and what are the trends (body style, color, and region)?
- Which dealer regions and companies are driving or lagging in sales?

- Enhance pricing strategies by offering value-added services (e.g., free maintenance, extended warranties) instead of reducing prices to maintain profitability.
